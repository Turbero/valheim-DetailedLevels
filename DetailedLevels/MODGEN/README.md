# Detailed Levels

Showcase link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhLkLpgBZ7I

The Detailed Levels plugin shows skills tracking with more details, including float level numbers and buffs to see their progress dynamically without checking the skills dialog all the time.

## Main features

Use the configuration file "Turbero.DetailedLevels.cfg" that will be created once the mod is executed for first time in order or a new in-game options panel to use the next features:
* Select any skill and see its progress dynamically as a buff on your screen
* Sort skills by name or level
* Choose how many decimals you want to see from 0 to 15 (default = 2)
* Choose how often you want to see the skill up messages in the center of your screen when you skill up (default = each 5 levels)
* Translated to ALL LANGUAGES
* NEW: Access your in-game player stats in the skills panel too!

For any concerns or doubts, please dm me or open tickets in my GitHub repos.

This is my first Valheim mod ever after learning the basics. It's difficult to come up with something not created yet by the whole modding community, which is amazing on the other hand.

I'll be doing my best! =)
