# Detailed Levels
The Detailed Levels plugin shows float level numbers with more accuracy in all skill levels to see how much you have left until next level.

This is my first Valheim mod ever after learning the basics. It's difficult to come up with something not created yet by the whole modding community, which is amazing on the other hand.

I'll be doing my best! =)
