# Detailed Levels
The Detailed Levels plugin shows skills tracking with more details, including float level numbers and buffs to see their progress dynamically without checking the skills dialog all the time.

## Main features

Use the configuration file "Turbero.DetailedLevels.cfg" that will be created once the mod is executed for first time in order to use the next features:
* Select any skill and see its progress dynamically as a buff on your screen
* Choose how many decimals you want to see from 0 to 15 (default = 2)
* Choose how often you want to see the yellow message in the center when you skill up (default = each 5 levels)
* Enable/disable the mod and the debug logs entirely (logs disabled by default)

This is my first Valheim mod ever after learning the basics. It's difficult to come up with something not created yet by the whole modding community, which is amazing on the other hand.

I'll be doing my best! =)
